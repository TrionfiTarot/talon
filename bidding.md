Bidding
=======

This a general rubric for beginning Talon players to decide what to bid. It's based on counting the number of “points” in your hand. These points aren't related to the scoring points in the rest of talon.

Add up your hand as follows.

* The World: 10 points
* The Fool: 8 points
* The Magician and four other trumps: 5 points
* The Magician and five other trumps: 6 points
* The Magician and six or more other trumps: 7 points
* If you have more than three trumps: 2 points for each trump
* Each major trump: 2 points
* Each major trump in a row: 1 point per trump in a row
* King and queen of the same suit: 10 points
* King without queen: 6 points
* Queen without king: 3 points
* Knight: 2 points
* Knave: 1 point
* Five cards of the same suit: 5 points
* Six cards of the same suit: 6 points
* Seven or more cards of the same suit: 7 points

The following points should only be counted for a possible guard without/against the talon bid:

* void in a suit: 6 points
* singleton in a suit: 3 points

If you have fewer than 40 points, you should pass.
 
If you 40-55 points, you should take.

If you have 56-70 points, you should guard.

If you have 71-80 points, you should guard without the talon.

If you have more than 80 points, you should guard against the talon.
