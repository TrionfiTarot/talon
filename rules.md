Rules of Talon
==============

Talon is a trick-based card game for three to five players, played over several hands. It is played with a 78-card tarot deck and, some tokens for scoring and bidding, and an extra token to indicate the dealer.

Game-related table-talk is discouraged, but banter at the table is encouraged. Is is poor form to use coded language to circumvent the restriction on table-talk.



Dealing
-------

Before the first hand, randomly pick who will deal first. It is customary for each player to cut the deck to decide who deals. The highest trump gets to deal. If there are no trumps, the highest card deals. The tie-breaker is suit. Swords are first, then cups, then pentacles, then wands.

The first dealer shuffles the deck thoroughly then passes the deck to their right. That player cuts or taps the deck then passes it back. Cards are dealt widdershins, starting with the player to the dealer's left. Cards are dealt to each player in packets. If there are four or five players, the packets are of three cards. If there are three players, packets are four cards.

There is an additional pile of cards: the eponymous talon which should be in the middle of the table. The dealer deals one packet to each player, puts one card in the talon, deals another packet to each player, then one to the talon and so on. This continues until the talon is full, at which point packets are only dealt to the players.

Players do not touch their hands until all the cards have been dealt. Nobody touches the talon until later in the game.

In a three-player, game the talon contains six cards and each hand is 24 cards. In a four-player game, the talon contains six cards and each hand is 18 cards. In a five player game the talon is three cards, and each hand is 15.

After the first hand, the deck is not shuffled; it is simply passed to the next dealer. The next dealer is the player to the right of the current dealer. The player to the new dealer's right still gets the opportunity to cut the deck.

After the cards are dealt, player take a moment to organize their hands.



Mulligans
---------

A number of situations call for a mulligan. If one of these arises players place their organized hands face down on top of the talon starting with the player to the dealer's right and continuing widdershins. The dealer role passes to the right, and the cards are re-dealt without shuffling.

**Misdeal** — If the dealer makes a mistake, someone must call out ‘misdeal’. The dealing is finished as best possible, players organize their hands, then the cards are mulliganned. A misdeal may also be noticed after the cards are dealt, when players are counting and organizing their hands.

**A little dry** — If a player has no trumps except the the Magician, they may call out “a little dry” and the cards are mulliganned.



Bidding
-------

Players bid to determine how much will be at stake for each game, and how difficult it will be. Bidding starts with the player to the dealer's right and continues widdershins. Bids are silently indicated by physical actions. A player may either make a higher bid than the previous one, or pass. There are five possible bids.

**Pass** — This player chooses not to bid, and will not participate from the remainder of the bidding. This bid is signified by placing one's hand face-down on the table.

**Take** — This is the first contract bid. This player is proposing to win a certain number of points and honors in this hand. This bid is signified by placing a single token in front of the player.

**Guard** — This contract is the same as a take, but worth twice as much. This bid is signified by placing two tokens in front of the player.

**Guard without the Talon** — This contract is worth four times as much as a take, and is more difficult. This bid is indicated with four tokens.

**Guard against the Talon** — This is the highest bid, a contract worth six times a take, and is more difficult than any of the previous bids. It is indicated with six tokens.

After bidding, whoever had the last non-pass bid becomes the taker, everyone else is defending. In a five-player game the taker will have a partner, determined a little later. The taker is trying to accumulate a certain number of points by winning tricks. The defenders work together to oppose the taker (and the taker's partner). The defenders share a score pile.

If every player chose to pass, the hand is mulliganned. 



Calling
-------

After the bids, player may make certain claims to raise the stakes or otherwise complicate the hand. These may happen in any order.


### Misery

A player whose hand contains either no trump cards or no court cards or both, they may declare ‘misery’. If they do, each other player must immediately give the caller ten points.


### Handful

A player whose hand is more than half trumps may choose to call a ‘handful’. This increases the value of the hand. There are three different handfuls and requires more trumps in the caller's hand. The number of trumps needed depends on the number of players.

| players | single | double | triple |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
|  three  |   13   |   15   |   18   |
|  four   |   10   |   13   |   15   |
|  five   |   8    |   10   |   13   |

A single handful adds a twenty-point bonus to the winner's score, whether the player who called the handful wins or loses. This bonus is not multiplied according to the contract. A double take adds a fourty-point bonus and a triple-take adds a sixty-point bonus.

After calling a handful, that player must reveal the required number of trumps in their hand. The trumps must be in order so that other players can easily inspect them. The fool may only be revealed this way if the calling player has *exactly* the right number of trumps and no others.


### Evasive Magician

If a player has no trumps except the the Magician (and they didn't call “a little dry” earlier), they must now announce that they have an evasive Magician. For the remainder of this hand, the Magician card is treated exactly like the Fool card.


### Slams

The taker may call a slam. This call is a promise to take a certain number of tricks this hand. There a two types of slam: a grand slam and a little slam. A grand slam means taking every single trick. A little slam means taking every trick but three.

A called grand slam is worth a 400-points bonus if the taker makes it, but costs a 200-point penalty if it is not achieved. A called little slam is worth a 300-point bonus if made, but costs a 150-point bonus if missed. 

A slam may also be made without being called, but their bonus is halved. The bonus from a slam is not multiplied according to the contract.

If a slam is called then the taker gets to start the first trick, instead of the player to the dealer's right.



Taker's partner
---------------

In a five-player game, the taker gets a partner. The taker's partner is decided after all calls have been made. The taker calls out the king of a particular suit. If the taker has all four kings, they may call a queen instead. Whichever defender has that king or queen becomes the taker's partner. If the king or queen was in the taker's hand or the talon, then the taker has no partner. The taker's partner does not immediately reveal themself. It is up to the defenders to identify the taker's partner.

In a five-player game, a defender may not lead the first trick with the suit that the taker called this way. The taker may lead this suit in the first trick, and the taker's partner may choose to lead the first trick in this suit only if they lead with the king or queen called.



Talon
-----

The talon is then disposed of and becomes the start of someone's score pile.

If the contract is a take, guard, or guard without the talon then the talon becomes part of the taker's score pile. If the contract is a guard against the talon then the talon becomes part of the defenders' score pile.

If the contract is a take or guard, the defender gets to look through the talon and trade any number of cards in the talon with cards in their hand. After this trading, the talon is left face-down, and both the talon and the taker's hand must have the same number of cards they had before the trading.

If the contract is a take without the talon or a take against the talon, nobody gets to look at the talon.



Play
----

Play consists of tricks. The player to the dealer's right leads the first trick by placing a card from their hand face up on the table. If a slam was called, the first trick is led by the taker instead.

Continuing widdershins each player places a card face up on top of the previous card until each player has played a card this way. Subsequent cards must follow the suit of the lead card. If a player does not have any card of that suit, they must play a trump. If they do not have a trump, they may play any card. If a trump was led, subsequent players must follow with a higher trump if they have one, otherwise they must follow with a lower trump. If they do not have a trump, they may play any card on a trump trick.

After each player has played one card in a trick the trick is won and placed on top of the winner's score pile, face down. The player who played the highest-numbered trump wins the trick. If there are no trumps, the highest card in the led suit wins.

After the trick is won, players are permitted a moment to inspect which cards are played but must not change the order of the cards.

Whichever player won the last trick leads the next. Play continues this way until all card have been played.


### Excuses

The Fool card is called the excuse. If an evasive Magician was called then the Magician card is also an excuse. The excuse may be played on any trick, regardless of above restrictions on which cards can be played in a trick. Despite being a trump, the excuse will not win any trick (with one exception).

If the player who played the excuse is not on the team which wins the trick, the excuse is placed on the score pile of the excuse-player's team rather than the trick-winner's team. This may reveal identity of the taker's partner. The team which won the trick is given a non-court, non-honor card in exchange.

The player who played the excuse turns over cards from their team's score pile until they find a non-court, non-honor card. This card is placed on the trick-winner's score pile. Those turned over cards are then put back face-down on their original score pile. If there is no non-court, non-honor card in the pile, the excuse is left face-up next to the pile. As soon as a non-court, non-honor card would be added to this pile, it is instead given to the player who won the trick with the excuse, and then the excuse is placed atop the pile.

The excuse may be led, but does not determine the suit of the trick. Instead, the second card played decides the suit which must be followed.

If the excuse is played in the last trick, it changes sides. Instead of going to the side of the player who played it, it goes to the opposite side.

If the excuse is led in the last trick, and the player leading with it has won every other trick, the leading player wins that trick and gets to keep the excuse.


### Magician's ending

If the Magician is not an excuse and the last trick is won with the Magician, there is a ten-point bonus or penalty. The player who wins the last trick this way gets to decide if the points are a bonus or a penalty. This bonus or penalty does not change the card score to determine which side wins the hand. Unlike all other bonuses or penalties, the Magician's ending is multiplied according to the contract.

This bonus or penalty also applies if the Magician wins the second-to-last trick and the Fool is played in the last trick. The winner of the second-to-last trick must decide if it's a bonus or a penalty before the last trick is led.



Scoring
-------

### Determining who wins

The number of points needed to win depends on the number of honors taken. Points to win come only from cards in the score piles and do not include any bonuses or multipliers. Cards in score plies worth the following:

* Kings and honors are 4 ½ points.
* Queens are 3 ½ points.
* Knights are 2 ½ points.
* Knaves are 1 ½ points.
* Other trumps and number cards are worth ½ a point.

When counting cards, the order of piles should not be changed. It's easiest to count cards in pairs, for whole numbers of points.

For the taker to win:

* With no honors, 56 points are needed to win.
* With one honor, 51 points are needed to win.
* With two honors, 41 points are needed to win.
* With three honors, 36 points are needed to win.

There are 91 points in a hand, so for the defenders to win:

* With no honors, 55 ½ points are needed to win.
* With one honor 50 ½ points are needed to win.
* With two honors, 40 ½ points are needed win.
* With no honors, 35 ½ points are needed to win.


### Transferring points

After deciding who wins, determine how many points the hand was worth.

The score starts at 25 points. Add the absolute value of the difference between the taker's score and the number of points needed to win, rounding up to a whole number. If there was a Magician's ending, add or subtract another ten. Multiply this sum as required by the contract, then add any handful or slam bonuses or penalties. This is the value of the hand.

If the taker won then each defender must give the taker the value of the hand. If the defenders won then the taker must give each defender the value of the hand.

If the taker had a partner, the taker pays or receives double this amount, while the partner pays or receives the amount specified. This means that a hand where the taker has a partner is worth triple to the defenders.


### Recording points

The easiest way to score Talon is to use a score sheet. Each player starts at zero. When a player pays points, they are subtracted. Received points are added. With this recording system, there is no specified end to the game. Since talon is at heart a gambling game, play is likely to end when the night is over or enough players have decided to cut their losses.

It is also possible to score with tokens. Since it's not practically possible to have a negative number of tokens, players must start with some number rather than zero. This provides an easy way to end the game: when one player runs out of tokens. You may instead choose only to eliminate a player who runs out of tokens, and continue playing with a smaller group.
