The Tarot Deck
==============

Summary
-------

The deck is 78 cards in five suits. Four of the suits correspond to the modern bridge suits; these suits contain fourteen cards and are normally called the ‘court suits’ or just plain ‘suits’. The fifth suit are trumps and has twenty-two cards; it's normally just called trumps. Each of the four suits contains ten numbered cards and four court cards. The court cards are: knave, knight, queen, and king. The one of the suit is the lowest and the king is highest. The one is never called an ‘ace’.

The trump suit has no court cards and is simply numbered zero to twenty-one. The trumps from one to fifteen are considered minor; numbers sixteen to twenty-one are major. Three trump cards are called the honors: zero, one, and twenty-one. The zero of trumps is also called the ‘excuse’, and the one of trumps is called the ‘little’.

In talon, each card is worth a certain number of points.

* kings and honors are 4 ½ points
* queens are 3 ½ points
* knights are 2 ½ points
* knaves are 1 ½ points
* other trumps and number cards are worth ½ a point.

Cards are usually counted in pairs to make whole numbers of points
